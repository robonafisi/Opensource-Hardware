# Opensource-Hardware
A collection of my favourite open source hardware projects. I like to reuse designs and have found it overwhelming to look for inspiration when I am working on various projects. I will try to add notes to each project to help others understand how it can be manufactured, used, and what software/hardware each project is compatible with. Contributions welcome!
